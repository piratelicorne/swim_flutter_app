# Swim App - Hackathon Contribution

Team Members: Aline, Edith and Melissa.

We participated in the Swim-42 Hackathon, which consisted in developing a mobile app using Flutter and Dart, as usually Hackathons last around 24 to 48 hours and we knew it was short time for us to deliver a good final product hehe üòÖ but we 3 wanted to hone our skills developing our part.

‚ö†Ô∏è This project is to practice.

## Version 1.1

## Structure

During the hackathon weekend our mobile app' structure (directory wise) was a little crazy... but following a medium article, here it is our new structure lib/:

- index.dart: file that export all the other dart files, this one must be imported(called) in files that have dependecies.
- images: Folder to hold the images/assets used in the project.
- screens: This folder contains the screens which will be configured in the routes in the main.dart file.
   In this case, will be the screens for: 'Pool chat', 'Group Chat', '1 to 1 Chat'.  
- models: models with information (usually from database).
   In this case, we will work with sample data.  
- utilities: All the common items goes in here, including resources for the README file.

## Themes

Setting themes and working with them is so much easy, we'd defined the mobile app's colors and fonts in the **app_theme** file for Light and Dark Theme, here in a example of the presets:

<img src="https://github.com/42-swim-hackaton/swim_flutter_app/blob/master/lib/utilities/resources/Light-Theme.png" alt="Light Theme" width="300" HSPACE="42"/>  <img src="https://github.com/42-swim-hackaton/swim_flutter_app/blob/master/lib/utilities/resources/Dark-Theme.png" alt="Dark Theme" width="300" HSPACE="42"/>

e.g.

‚≠êÔ∏è In order to set color, do this:

```
  static Color _lightPrimaryVariantColor = Color(0xFF15A8A4);

  static final ThemeData lightTheme üü° = ThemeData(
    scaffoldBackgroundColor: _lightPrimaryColor,
    appBarTheme: AppBarTheme(
      color: _lightPrimaryVariantColor,
      iconTheme: IconThemeData(
        color: _lightOnPrimaryColor,
      ),
    ),
    textTheme: _lightTextTheme, üü¢
  );
  
   static final TextTheme _lightTextTheme üü¢  = TextTheme(
    headlineüîµ: _lightScreenHeadingTextStyle, üü£
    display1: _lightScreenButtonText,
    body2: _lightScreenWidgetTitle, 
  );
  
   static final TextStyle _lightScreenHeadingTextStyle üü£ = TextStyle(
    fontFamily: "RobotoMono",  
    fontSize: 21.0,
    color: _lightPrimaryColor,
  );
```

   You must use it this way:
```
void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      title: 'Swim App Hackathon Contribution',
      theme: AppTheme.lightTheme, üü°
      darkTheme: AppTheme.darkTheme,
      home: Home(),
    )
  );
  
  class Home extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(
           title: Text(
             'Navigate Life',
             style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline üîµ,
             ),
           ),
         ),
         ...
       );
      }
    }
```
   This line, is the one who make use of the color according to the theme, either the light or the dark one -> ```style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline,```

‚≠êÔ∏è If you change the value for **_lightPrimaryVariantColor**, the AppBar will change automatically the background color :) and so on...
